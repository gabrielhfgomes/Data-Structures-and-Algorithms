R-9.4 An airport is developing a computer simulation of air-traffic control that handles
events such as landings and takeoffs. Each event has a time stamp that denotes
the time when the event will occur. The simulation program needs to efficiently
perform the following two fundamental operations:
• Insert an event with a given time stamp (that is, add a future event).
• Extract the event with smallest time stamp (that is, determine the next event
to process).
Which data structure should be used for the above operations? Why?
