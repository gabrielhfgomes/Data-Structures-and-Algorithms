R-14.16 Let G be an undirected graph whose vertices are the integers 1 through 8, and let
the adjacent vertices of each vertex be given by the table below:
vertex adjacent vertices
1 (2, 3, 4)
2 (1, 3, 4)
3 (1, 2, 4)
4 (1, 2, 3, 6)
5 (6, 7, 8)
6 (4, 5, 7)
7 (5, 6, 8)
8 (5, 7)
Assume that, in a traversal of G, the adjacent vertices of a given vertex are returned in the same order as they are listed in the table above.
a. Draw G.
b. Give the sequence of vertices of G visited using a DFS traversal starting at
vertex 1.
c. Give the sequence of vertices visited using a BFS traversal starting at vertex 1



B- DFS a partir do vertice 1 - 1,2,3,4,6,7,5,8.

C- BFS a partir do vertice 1 - 1,2,3,4,6,7,5,8.
